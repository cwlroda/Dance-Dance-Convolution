# Dance Dance Convolution
This project is an interactive gesture recognition game inspired by Just Dance 2019.

_Note: This game was part of a first year college project. Development was centred around an FPGA board (Xilinx PYNQ-Z1) and hence can only be run on one._

# Instructions
The objective of the game is to replicate arm gestures shown on the screen and score as many points as possible.

# Symbols
There are a total of 16 different combinations of arm positions to be replicated. Symbols such as the ones below will be displayed on the screen as a guide on how to perform the gesture.
