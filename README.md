# Dance Dance Convolution
This project is an interactive gesture recognition game inspired by Just Dance 2019.

Note: This game was part of a college project. Development was centred around an FPGA board (Xilinx PYNQ-Z1) and hence can only be run on one.

# Instructions
The objective of the game is to replicate arm gestures shown on the screen and score as many points as possible.
